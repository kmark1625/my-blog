This article seeks to explain what a CSS preprocessor is and why you should use it. In addition, I explain my own experience using Bourbon along with Neat and Bitters to style sites. These tools allow for an easy way to maintain modular code in your CSS as well as get a good-lucking site off the ground quickly.
