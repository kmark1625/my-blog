This blog post seeks to explain why you should use Middleman to generate your next static site. Middleman is an excellent tool which shares a lot of similarities with Ruby on Rails. In building a static site with Middleman, you are able to learn a lot of core concepts in Ruby on Rails or transfer your common workflows from Ruby on Rails to Middleman.

First of all, you might ask why should you use a static site instead of something like a Ruby on Rails site. A static site is much easier to host (doesn't require additional server/database overhead other than the files themselves) and often results in performance and security benefits. A static site generator helps in the creation of a static site by allowing you to write code in embedded ruby, use css preprocessors or markdown, and the static site generator will translate the code into base css/html.

There are many concepts with a Middleman site that is similar to rails. Middleman shares a similar asset pipeline along with file structure. In addition, you can continue to write embedded ruby into your files.
