<p>I set out with the goal of solving 500 problems of Project Euler in 3 months. Below is a set of lessons that I learned along the way from each set of problems. I decided to approach the problems sequentially and would not move on from a given set until all problems in that set were completed. I had to learn about numerous topics in coding and mathematics in order to complete the challenge. I hope this article will be helpful for a reader who is seeking to attempt a similar challenge for themselves or just a reader who is curious what the journey is like.</p>

<h2>Problems 1-25</h2>

<h3>Math</h3>
<p>There are some fundamental mathematical concepts that are required in order to solve the first set of problems</p>
<h4>Prime Numbers</h4>
<p>Explanation of prime numbers.</p>
<h4>Factors</h4>
<p>Explanation of factors</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>
<h4>Test Driven Development</h4>
<p>I found test driven development to be essential in order to determine if an answer was correct</p>
<h4>Itertools and Generator Functions</h4>
<p>Example</p>
<h4>Object-Oriented Approach</h4>
<p>I found some problems lent themselves to solving with an object-oriented approach</p>
