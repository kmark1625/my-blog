- name: Fantasy Wars
  description: Fantasy Wars is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. Players can select one of three races and battle on four different maps against another player or a computer opponent. I worked with designing the overall gameplay structure, implementing key gameplay features as well as the AI for the computer player. I also led the code-review process and the version control workflow (git/Github). Fantasy Wars was built with Javascript and the Phaser framework.

- name: Restaurant Challenge
  description: This project seeks to address the problem of ordering in a restaurant. Given a desired amount of money you wish to spend, the site allows users to find a combination of items that add up to the order exactly. This is a NP-hard problem. As such, the expected runtime of the solution is exponential with the number of menu items and target price. A trade-off was made to prevent large menus or a very high target price from being loaded rather than forcing the user to wait. Performance testing was performed to prevent menus that would result in greater than a 15 second wait.
