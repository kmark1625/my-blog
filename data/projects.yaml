- name: Fantasy Wars
  description: Fantasy Wars is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. Players can select one of three races and battle on four different maps against another player or a computer opponent. I worked with designing the overall gameplay structure, implementing key gameplay features as well as the AI for the computer player. I also led the code-review process and the version control workflow (git/Github). Fantasy Wars was built with Javascript and the Phaser framework.
